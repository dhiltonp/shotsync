Shotsync aims to sync photos from your camera to your phone as conveniently as possible.

It does a batch download of files when your phone connects to your camera via wifi. Only new files taken within the configured window are downloaded.

Currently using an Olympus E-M5 Mk II for development.

TODO:
 - support more cameras (E-M1 III, E-M5 III etc.)
 - add on-camera/raw geotagging
 - support saving to sd cards
 - add storage cap setting
 - clarify what deleting saved images does
